# SQL-Credit-Risk-Analysis

A simulated credit bureau dataset will be used to identify potential business opportunities for a client.

Queries will be created to answer the following questions:

        1.	What is the main motivation for credit acquisition?
        2.	What is the default rate for the loan with the highest demand?
        3.	Which loans have the lowest default rate?
        4.	Is there an ideal age group that can be targeted for loans?
        5.	What is the average loan amount for age groups with 30% or below utilisation?

All analysis, outputs and SQL Queries can be obtained in the main file folders.
